# Python Math Toolkit

Welcome to Python Math Toolkit! This toolkit provides a set of Python scripts for common mathematical operations such as checking prime numbers, finding factorial, and more.

## Features

- **Check Prime Number:** Determine whether a given number is prime or not.
- **Calculate Factorial:** Find the factorial of a given integer.
- **Support Vector Machine (SVM):** Train and visualize a Support Vector Machine with a linear kernel.

## How to Use

1. **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/NitinKumar2024/Python_Projects.git
    ```

2. **Navigate to the project directory:**

    ```bash
    cd Python_Projects
    ```

3. **Install dependencies:**

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

4. **Run the scripts:**

    - **Check Prime Number:**
        ```bash
        python isPrime.py
        ```
    
    - **Calculate Factorial:**
        ```bash
        python find_factorial.py
        ```

    - **Support Vector Machine (SVM):**
        ```python
        from machine_learning_model import svm
        svm()
        ```

## Examples

- **Check Prime Number:**

    ```bash
    Enter a number: 17
    Output: Prime
    ```

- **Calculate Factorial:**

    ```bash
    Enter a number: 5
    Output: 120
    ```
